# Roary Tubbs WP Theme
This is a custom WordPress theme for Roary Tubbs.

## Sass
The main style.css file is built by Sass. To make changes to styles, you want to edit the files
within `/sass`. The root entry file is `/sass/style.css`, which should only be used for importing
other partials.

A couple of CLI commands you'll want when working with Sass are below:

- Watch entire sass directory for changes and build automatically
  - `npm run sass:watch`

```
