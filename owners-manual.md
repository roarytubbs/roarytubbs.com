# Roary Tubbs Owner’s Manual

_A concise reference for how to collaborate with me day‑to‑day. Feel free to ask if anything here isn’t clear or looks off._
## Snapshot
- **Role:** Staff Product Designer @ Vanta
- **Location:** Oklahoma City, Central Time
- **Faith, Family & Community:** Wife + three boys; active in church & local service
- **Passions:** Camping, backpacking (summited 10×14ers), hiking, building projects, remodels, learning new hands‑on skills (e.g., electrical work & plumbing)


## Communication
- **Primary:** @‑mention in Slack; email checked ~2× week
- **Public channels > DMs** (visibility + shared context)
- **Intent‑brackets / emoji** for tone & urgency (e.g., `[FYI]`, `[Needs async review]`)
- **Loom** videos for async walkthroughs & design context
- In focus‑mode Slack is snoozed please don’t expect instant replies 🔕

### Recieving feedback
- **Direct, timely, balanced** (wins + deltas) — feedback is a gift 🎁
- Clarify urgency buckets: *now / this quarter / FYI*
- Quick Slack for minor notes; video chat for high‑stakes topics
- Prefer feedback directly from the source; if I’m not getting any, I assume things are peachy 🟢

### Giving feedback
When I give feedback, I like to make my intent clear. That way, you don’t have to guess how strongly I feel about a point or how I’d recommend you to act on it. I use little `[signal blocks]` to show where I’m coming from. Think of them as shorthand cues—no need to respond unless you want to.

#### Signal blocks
| Flag | Meaning | How to process feedback |
| ------------- | --- | --- |
| [👏 Kudos]    | Landed really well, great work! | Soak it in. You nailed it. No action needed except maybe a little self-high-five. |
| [🤔 Consider] | I see potential in this but I’m less certain. | Give this some thought. If you take a different path, just be ready to share the “why” behind your decision. |
| [💡 Idea]     | A thought, not a mandate, might spark something useful. | Use it, remix it, or skip it. Totally your call. |
| [❓ Question] | I’m unclear on intent or would like more context. | Help me understand your thinking so I can give sharper feedback next time. |
| [⚡️ Action]   | I feel strongly about this. | Please implement this. If you disagree, let’s talk it through—I value the discussion as much as the outcome. |


## How I work

### Rhythms & structure
Weekly cadence, rituals, availability
- Typical hours **9 AM – 5:30 PM** CST (kid drop‑off may slide start ±30 min)
- **Mornings = Deep Focus** · **Afternoons = Meetings / Collaboration**
- **Weekly anchors**
  - End‑of‑week retros
  - Data review 
  - Reading / learning / education block
  - “Play” or experimental exploration time
  - **Non‑project time** for data dives and customer conversations
- Short post‑meal walks (Type‑1 diabetes mgmt.); schedule flexes for health
- No Slack / email on phone after hours or weekends

### Focus conditions
Deep work, async prep, meeting boundaries
- Quiet environment → enables deep problem‑solving (ADHD)
- Clear **goals, milestones, deadlines** or I’ll spin cycles ⚙️
- Space to think before workshops; pairing once I’ve framed the problem
- Authenticity & grace  assume positive intent, no passive‑aggressive vibes
- Shield me from “chaos energy” when possible so I can stay strategic ✨

### Struggles & support
- ADHD → hyper‑focus on details if milestones unclear; gentle nudges welcome
- Public speaking: work in progress (I talk fast!) — help me pace
- Not highly expressive; if I’m quiet assume I’m focused, not grumpy 😅
- Visual design - always trying to improve my craft

### Self debugging prompts
1. Are we asking the right question?
2. What’s the simplest version of this?
3. What’s the magic moment of this version?
4. What would get somebody talking about this?

## Principles & values
1. **Builder‑for‑Builders:** empower devs through ergonomic tools
2. **Comprehension > Configuration:**  reduce cognitive load
3. **Ship → Learn → Iterate:** smallest meaningful increment, measurable impact
4. **Keep the Trust Jar Full:** details, reliability, consistency
5. **Make the Easy Things Easy:** fast time‑to‑value & inclusive onboarding
6. **Just Because You Can Doesn’t Mean You Should:** customer impact over ego features

### Things I love at work
- Hearing how others solve problems & sharing war‑stories
- Running workshops; facilitating ideation & research sessions
- Rapid prototyping: design in Figma → AI → test with customers
- A culture that treats work as fun and safe to fail, learn, iterate
- Ship often and iteratively

### Team culture
- Shared conviction in product & customer problem
- Culture willing to experiment, **ship → learn → iterate (be iteratively correct, it’s okay to get it wrong)**
- Strong collaboration & trust; design respected for business impact
- High‑caliber engineers who love building *with* design

## How I partner

### Engineering
- Design **shouldn’t block starting**, but it should block shipping quality
- Ask early: **Do we need designs?** ▶ Can we design in the browser? ▶ Will annotated screenshots do? Now build out an AI prototype?
- **Intent frames** to clarify intent + constraints
- Code > Figma; product is the source of truth
- I trust my engineers, if you have an idea or notices something, I want to hear it!
- **Red flags:** design black‑box, surprise scope changes, unclear “latest”

### Product
- Start from trust. We default to good intent, share context openly, and keep each other unblocked.
- Shared support
- Mutual proxies. If one of us isn’t in the room, the other can represent product or design—because we’ve aligned on the narrative and trade‑offs.
- I wear a product hat. I’m comfortable drafting PRDs, running research, and doing investigation—just point me where to go deep vs. stay high‑level.
- One plan, one story. We maintain a single shared thread: problem → audience/ICP → goals → bets → metrics → ship plan.
- Problem‑first PRDs. Either of us can draft; we co‑edit. PM brings segmentation, ICPs, and business context; Design brings UX hypotheses, flows, and test plans.
